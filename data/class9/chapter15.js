        { question: "What is probability?", answer: "Probability is the measure of the likelihood of an event occurring, ranging from 0 (impossible) to 1 (certain)." },
        { question: "Experiment?", answer: "A process or action that leads to well-defined outcomes." },
        { question: "Random experiment?", answer: "An experiment whose outcome cannot be predicted with certainty." },
        { question: "Outcome?", answer: "A possible result of an experiment." },
        { question: "Sample space?", answer: "The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment." },
        { question: "Event?", answer: "A subset of the sample space; a particular outcome or group of outcomes." },
        { question: "Favourable outcome?", answer: "An outcome in which the event of interest occurs." },
        { question: "Classical definition of probability?", answer: "Probability of an event E = (Number of favourable outcomes) / (Total number of outcomes) if all outcomes are equally likely." },
        { question: "Probability of impossible event?", answer: "0." },
        { question: "Probability of certain event?", answer: "1." },
        { question: "Complementary events?", answer: "Two events where one occurs if the other does not; P(E) + P(E') = 1." },
        { question: "Probability of tossing a coin:", answer: "P(Head) = 1/2, P(Tail) = 1/2." },
        { question: "Probability of rolling a die:", answer: "P(Each face) = 1/6." },
        { question: "Sum of probabilities of all outcomes in sample space?", answer: "Always 1." },
        { question: "Applications of probability?", answer: "Used in gambling, weather forecasting, insurance, statistics, and decision making." },
        { question: "Law of large numbers?", answer: "As the number of trials increases, the experimental probability approaches the theoretical probability." },
        { question: "Simple event?", answer: "An event consisting of a single outcome." },
        { question: "Compound event?", answer: "An event consisting of two or more simple events." },
        { question: "Mutually exclusive events?", answer: "Events that cannot occur at the same time." },
        { question: "Addition rule of probability?", answer: "For mutually exclusive events A and B: P(A âˆª B) = P(A) + P(B)." }
