        { question: "Constructing a bisector of a line segment?", answer: "Draw arcs from both endpoints with same radius, join intersection points to bisect the segment." },
        { question: "Constructing a bisector of an angle?", answer: "Draw an arc from vertex cutting both arms, draw arcs from intersection points, join vertex to intersecting arc." },
        { question: "Constructing perpendicular from a point on line?", answer: "Use compass to draw arcs on both sides, then intersect arcs above and below the line, join point to intersection." },
